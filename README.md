# Centaur Security

## Goal: 

Bringing Machine Learning into Security 
- Demonstrate machine learning's prominence and how it it can be leveraged.
- Develop a machine learning model that can move beyond simple automation and orchestration.  
- Analyze data to produce threat intelligence.  
- Apply real-world use cases within Optum to drive the practical application and protect intellectual and proprietary information.

## Problem Statement  
The advent of open source computing, promotion of code / knowledge sharing and expanding one's circle of influence has lead to an unintended consequence. That of the malicious insider stealing company proprietary information and exfiltrating it from the corporate network.  


## Use Cases:  
Threats to intellectual property: intentional leakage from code repositories by malicious insiders  

Threats to intellectual property: unintentional leakage from code repositories by inexperienced developers/engineers/architects  

Threats to resources from statistical analysis of behaviour indicative of malicious intent  

Threats unknowingly injected from code repositories through 3rd party usage of open source content
